# Class-Connect
Class connect is to manage the learning process

The main objective of a Class connect is to manage the learning process. It is a system because it works in an automated, pre-determined way. It is designed to make life easier for those in charge of training and developmentâ€”e.g., identifying and assessing individual and organizational learning goals, tracking progress toward meeting those goals and collecting and presenting data for supervising the learning process.

Technologies Used:
JSP, SERVLET, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, DATABASE
